Differences between Classes and Objects in Java
Defining Classes and Objects in Java and Identifying Their Conceptual Differences
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), objects are used to organize the program instead of logic and actions (GeeksforGeeks, 2025). OOP fetches data and its methods into a single location. A class is an operator-defined blueprint that lays the groundwork for its objects, which outlines its structures and behaviors.  Objects are derived from the class and are known as instances of the class. An object contains attributes (state) and methods (behaviors), such as those of real-life entities. When an object of a class is created (declared), the class is then instantiated. Initializing an object is done through the use of the new operator or dynamically through using the Constructor.newInstance() method. 
An important conceptual difference between classes and objects lies in memory allocation. A class does not allocate or occupy memory until after the class is instantiated, meaning when an object is created. Whereas objects do occupy memory and store actual data. It is also important to note that a class defines structure and behavior, while an object represents a concrete instance with real data.
